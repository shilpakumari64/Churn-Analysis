# Customer Churn Analysis Project  

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn to understand its causes and provide actionable insights for business decision-making. Using **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, I performed an end-to-end analysis, from ETL to interactive dashboard creation.  

## Key Objectives  
- Understand customer churn trends and identify high-risk segments.  
- Highlight the impact of factors like contracts, payment methods, demographics, and service usage on churn.  
- Present insights through a visually engaging Power BI dashboard.  

## Tools Used  
- **Excel**: Data exploration and initial cleaning.  
- **SQL**: Data transformation, ETL processes, and metric calculations.  
- **Power BI**: Advanced data visualization and dashboard creation.  

## Key Features  
1. **ETL Process**  
   - Data cleaning and handling null values in SQL.  
   - Transformation of raw data into an analysis-ready format.  

2. **Power Query Transformations**  
   - Added calculated columns for churn status, monthly charge ranges, age groups, and tenure groups.  
   - Unpivoted service columns for comprehensive service insights.  

3. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   - KPIs: Churn rate, total customers, churned customers, and new joiners.  
   - Visualizations:  
     - Demographics (age, gender).  
     - Churn breakdown by contracts, payment methods, and services.  
     - Geographic trends and service usage analysis.  

## Insights  
- **Contracts and payment methods** significantly influence churn.  
- Customers with shorter tenures and certain service combinations are more likely to churn.  
- Geographic and demographic trends provide actionable strategies for retention.  

## Learnings  
This project strengthened my skills in **data analytics**, **ETL processes**, and **data visualization**. It showcases my ability to transform raw data into valuable business insights.
